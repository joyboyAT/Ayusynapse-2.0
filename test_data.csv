"A 57-year old farmer was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease a year ago. He experiences slowness of movement and tremors. His past medical history is significant for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He lives with his wife. They have three children. He used to be active with planting and taking care of their farm animals before his diagnosis. The patient complains of shaking and slow movement. He had difficulty entering through a door, as he was frozen and needed guidance to step in. His handwriting is getting smaller. He is on Levodopa and Trihexyphenidyl. He stated his medications help with shaking and slow movement. But he still has difficulty initiating movements, stiffness and slowness in general.

His medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism. He smokes cigarette 1 pack per day for 40 years and alcohol consumption of 5 to 6 beers per week. He is not aware about his family history. He is using Levothyroxine, Atorvastatin and HTCZ. His vital signs were stable in the primary evaluation. Left-sided facial droop, dysarthria, and left-sided hemiplegia were seen in the physical exam. His National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was calculated as 7. Initial CT angiogram of head and neck reported no acute intracranial findings. Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) was administered as well as high-dose statin therapy. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit to be monitored for 24 hours. MRI of the head revealed an acute 1.7-cm infarct of the right periventricular white matter and posterior right basal ganglia.","INCLUSION CRITERIA:

             hyperthyroidism, extreme iodine deficiency, and inherited forms of hypothyroidism
             resulting from abnormalities in the expression of genes coding for the TSH- beta
             subunit, Pax-8, TTF-2, Pit-I, Tg, PDS, and NIS.

          2. Patients with thyroid function test (TFT) abnormalities due to:

               -  Abnormalities of serum TH binding proteins leading to euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia

        Inclusion and exclusion criteria for each group of subjects are given below.

        Patients with known or suspected thyroid abnormalities will be eligible to p rticipate if
        the individual meets all of the following criteria:

          1. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the
             duration of the study.

          2. Male or female, aged 6 months+.

        Hyperthyroid states include but are not restricted to:

          1. Graves' disease (GD) thought to result from thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins
             (TSIg's), a subclass of which also stimulate eye muscle and fatty tissue producing
             exophthalmos (Graves' ophthalmopathy), as well as the skin in the pretibial area
             causing pretibial myxedema (Graves' dermopathy);

          2. Subacute thyroiditis (SAT), a painful inflammation thought to result from viral
             infection with Coxsackie, as well as other viruses;

          3. Silent thyroiditis, a painless inflammation thought to result from autoimmune attack
             of thyrocytes by antimicrosomal antibodies directed against thyroid peroxidase (TPO),
             as well as antithyroglobulin(anti-Tg) antibodies;

          4. Single or multiple hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules of unknown etiology, probably
             resulting from the activation of certain thyroid oncogenes and/or growth factors, such
             as the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor (TSHR) and the a-subunit of the G protein (Ga);

          5. Iodide-induced hyperthyroidism of unknown etiology;

          6. Surreptitious administration of thyroid hormone (TH), usually present in patients with
             underlying psychiatric disease or occasionally related to patients with obesity and
             other eating disorders

          7. Trophoblastic neoplasms, thought to result from high levels of hCG secretion, which,
             because of its structural similarity to TSH, causes ""spillover"" of action at the TSHR
             level;

          8. ""Inappropriate"" secretion of TSH, which may be present either in patients with TSH-
             producing pituitary tumors (TSHomas) or from a non-neoplastic cause, i.e. pituitary
             resistance to the action of thyroid hormone (3,4).

        Hypothyroid states include but are not restricted to:

          1. Primary (or thyroidal) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from auto-antibodies to
             thyroid proteins, such as antimicrosomal antibodies to TPO usually associated with
             lymphocytic (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis (HT) or atrophic thyroiditis, or blocking
             antibodies to the TSHR, usually in the context of non-goitrous hypothyroidism;

          2. Secondary (or pituitary) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from tumors of the
             pituitary of non-thyrotropic origin such, as growth hormone (GH)-secreting tumors or
             prolactinomas;

          3. Tertiary (or hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from a deficiency in the
             hypothalamic hormone thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), either of unknown etiology
             or secondary to a pituitary tumor;

          4. Bio-inactive TSH, either relating to an endogenous abnormality of hypothalamic
             hormones or secondary to pituitary tumors (and usually related to abnormal
             glycosylation patterns of the TSH molecule);

          5. Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH), a disease which has been shown to be
             due to abnormalities in the TH receptor, c-erbA-beta (or TR- beta).

        The above are the principal disorders under study, but we may also investigate other
        abnormalities, such as extreme iodine deficiency, and inherited forms of hypothyroidism
        resulting from abnormalities in the expression of genes coding for the TSH- beta subunit,
        Pax-8, TTF-2, Pit-I, Tg, PDS, and NIS (among others).

        (Hoehn and Yahr Stages II to IV) with levodopa-associated motor response complications,
        including wearing-off fluctuations and peak-dose dyskinesias.

        No presence or history of any medical condition that can reasonably be expected to subject
        the patient to unwarranted risk.

        No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities including liver enzyme elevations more
        than three times the upper limit of normal, or neutropenia (WBC less than 4000).

        No parkinson's disease patients exhibiting diphasic or end-of-dose dyskinesias or disabling
        dystonia.

        Since LY300164 is an inhibitor of CP4503A4, patients receiving certain drugs metabolized by
        that pathway will not be included.

        No patients who are unable to be treated with levodopa/carbidopa alone or a single,
        relatively short-acting dopamine agonist.

        No patients who require additional treatment with amantadine or other concomitant
        medications.

        No pregnant women or those not practicing effective means of birth control since the
        influence of any investigational compound on the unborn child and reproductive organs is
        unknown.",Study of LY300164 for the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease,1
