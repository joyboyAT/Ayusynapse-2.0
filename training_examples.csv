        group will undergo treatment with Rituximab Fludarabine. To meet treatment criteria
        patients in the intermediate risk group should have evidence of active disease as
        demonstrated by at least one of the following criteria:

          1. massive or progressive splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy;

          2. presence of weight loss greater than 10% over the preceding 6 months;

          3. constitutional symptoms of extreme fatigue, night sweats or recurrent fever of greater
             than 100 degrees F (documented fevers must be occurring without evidence of specific
             infection), and bone pain;

          4. progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of greater than 50% over a 2 month period,
             or an anticipated doubling time of less than 6 months;

          5. chronic infections either increased number or prolonged infections;

          6. other high risk prognostic indicators such as excess elevation of
             beta-2-microglobulin, cluster differentiation 38 (CD38) expression and adverse
             cytogenetics may be used to better appraise the risk in each individual patient.

        Patients with a diagnosis of CLL/SLL who do not meet the eligibility criteria for receiving
        Rituximab and Fludarabine (are not intermediate- or high-risk CLL/SLL), can enroll on the
        protocol for the purpose of donating cellular products. Such patients will not receive
        rituximab and fludarabine chemotherapy. At a later date, if it is documented that the
        patient does meet the criteria, then the patient may receive Rituximab and Fludarabine
        (after discussion with the Principal Investigator).

        In a limited number of cases, patients with low-risk CLL/SLL may be initiated on Rituximab
        and Fludarabine treatment. For example, individuals who are candidates for bone marrow
        transplantation may be started on Rituximab Fludarabine as an induction regimen prior to
        transplantation. Additionally, some low-risk patients may be started on Rituximab and
        Fludarabine for psychological reasons (patient insistence on starting chemotherapy prior to
        disease progression). However, it must be stressed that low-risk CLL/SLL patients will be
        discouraged from initiating therapy except in these specific cases.

        Patients 18-75 years of age. The upper age limit was chosen as it is felt that the
        toxicities would exceed potential benefit in this older population.

        Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 80%.

        Life expectancy greater than 6 months.

        Left ventricular ejection fraction has to be greater than 50% by either multi-gated
        acquisition scan (MUGA) or 2-D echo.

        Carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) greater than 50% of the expected value when
        corrected for hemoglobin (Hb)(96).

        Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl and a creatinine clearance greater than or equal
        to 50 ml/min.

        surface antigen negative and without evidence of active infection. Patients must be
        Hepatitis C negative.

        Not pregnant or lactating. Patients of childbearing potential must use an effective method
        of contraception. The effects of the chemotherapy, the subsequent transplant and the
        medications used after the transplant are highly likely to be harmful to a fetus. The
        effects upon breast milk are also unknown and may potentially be harmful to the infant.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA: Donor:

        Age 18-75 years. As the potential cerebrovascular and cardiac complications may potentially
        increase with age, age 75 has been chosen arbitrarily as the upper age limit. However, if
        it is determined after initial accrual of patients in this upper age range that this
        procedure is relatively safe, the age range may be extended.

        No physical contraindications to stem cell donation (i.e. severe atherosclerosis,
        auto-immune disease, cerebrovascular accident, active malignancy (97). Patients with severe
        atherosclerosis by history will receive a cardiology consult and be judged eligible on a
        case by case basis.

        Donors must be HIV-negative, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg-), and Hepatitis C antibody
        negative. This is to prevent the possible transmission of these infections to the
        recipient.

        Not pregnant or lactating. Donors of childbearing potential must use an effective method of
        contraception. The effects of cytokine administration on a fetus are unknown and may be
        potentially harmful. The effects upon breast milk are also unknown and may potentially be
        harmful to the infant.

        Normal cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) numbers as

             1.1 Patients with operable, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the female
             breast and positive lymph nodes. Node positivity may be determined by either an
             axillary node dissection or a positive sentinel node finding by immunohistochemistry
             or histology. This includes any patient with one or more positive lymph nodes whose
             tumors are T0, T1, 2 or 3 and N1, N2, MO. Patients with metaplastic carcinoma are
             eligible. Bilateral disease does not exclude patients from entry.

             1.2 Tumors that are locally advanced at diagnosis are not eligible. This is left to
             investigator judgment. Patients with tumors fixed to the chest wall, peau d'orange
             skin changes, skin ulcerations, or clinical inflammatory changes (T4 disease) are
             excluded from this study. Dermal lymphatic involvement noted on pathology without
             clinical inflammatory changes will not exclude a patient from this study.

             1.3 Patients with any ERP/PgR status are eligible.

          2. Prior treatment:

             2.1 <84 days from mastectomy or within 84 days of axillary dissection if the patient's
             most extensive breast surgery was a breast sparing procedure.

             2.2 Surgical resection margins - All tumor should be removed by either a modified
             radical mastectomy or a segmental mastectomy. Node dissection: patients may have had
             either an axillary node dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy before beginning
             treatment on protocol.

               -  Mastectomy: There should be no evidence of gross or microscopic tumor at the
                  surgical resection margins noted in the final surgery or pathology reports for
                  patients who have had a modified radical mastectomy. Patients with close margins
                  (tumor < 1 mm from margin) are eligible.

               -  Segmental mastectomy (lumpectomy): Although clear margins are preferable, DCIS or
                  LCIS at the surgical resection margin will not render a patient who has undergone
                  a segmental mastectomy ineligible for this study. Invasive tumor at the final
                  resection margin will render a patient ineligible.

             2.3 No prior chemotherapy.

             2.4 No prior radiation therapy for this malignancy. Patients who received radiation to
             the breast for DCIS are eligible. Patients who have had segmental mastectomy will be
             treated with radiotherapy according to standard procedures in the treating physician's
             institution after completion of all chemotherapy. Patients who have had modified
             radical mastectomy may also receive radiotherapy at the discretion of the treating
             physician according to institutional guidelines.

             2.5 Patients may receive up to four weeks of tamoxifen therapy for this malignancy and
             still be eligible for study entry. Patients who received tamoxifen for purposes of
             chemoprevention (e.g., Breast Cancer Prevention Trial) or for other indications
             (including previous breast cancer) are eligible. Tamoxifen therapy should be
             discontinued before the patient is enrolled on this study.

          -  A patient with skeletal pain is eligible for inclusion in the study if bone scan
             and/or roentgenological examination fails to disclose metastatic disease. Suspicious
             findings must be confirmed as benign by x-ray, MRI, or biopsy.

          -  Patients with prior nonbreast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-

          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Special conditions for eligibility of lumpectomy patients: Irradiation and surgery.
             Patients treated by lumpectomy and axillary node dissection (or no axillary dissection
             if sentinel node biopsy is negative) to be followed by breast radiation therapy must
             meet all the eligibility criteria in addition to the following:

               -  Generally, lumpectomy should be reserved for tumors less than 5 cm. However, at
                  the investigator's discretion, patients treated with lumpectomy for tumors
                  greater than or equal to 5 cm are eligible.

               -  The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive
                  tumor and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). For patients in whom pathologic
                  examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional
                  operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is
                  permissible even if axillary dissection has been performed. Patients in whom
                  tumor is still present at the resected margins after re-excision(s) must undergo
                  total mastectomy to be eligible.

        Ineligibility.

             interpretation of bone x-rays.

          -  Ulceration, erythema, infiltration of the skin or the underlying chest wall (complete
             fixation), peau d'orange, or skin edema of any magnitude. (Tethering or dimpling of
             the skin or nipple inversion should not be interpreted as skin infiltration. Patients
             with these conditions are eligible.)

          -  Ipsilateral lymph nodes that on clinical examination are found to be fixed to one
             another or to other structures (cN2 disease).

          -  Suspicious palpable nodes in the contralateral axilla or palpable supraclavicular or
             infraclavicular nodes, unless there is biopsy evidence that these are not involved
             with tumor.

          -  Prior therapy for breast cancer, including irradiation, chemotherapy, biotherapy,
             and/or hormonal therapy, with the exception of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen may be given as
             adjuvant therapy before study entry, but only if it was started within 28 days before
             randomization. Patients who started tamoxifen within 28 days before randomization and
             who are being considered for chemotherapy must have their tamoxifen stopped at the
             start of chemotherapy.

          -  Prior history of breast cancer, except LCIS.

          -  Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement
             therapy, etc. (These patients are eligible only if this therapy is discontinued prior
             to randomization.) Exceptions: patients may use low-dose estrogen vaginal creams or
             Estring® for symptomatic vaginal dryness, raloxifene (or other selective estrogen
             receptor modulators [SERMs]) for the prevention of osteoporosis, and
             luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists/antagonists for the purpose of
             medical ovarian ablation as a component of adjuvant therapy for the breast cancer.

          -  Patients currently taking alendronate (Fosamax®) or other bisphosphonates or
             calcitonin to treat or prevent osteoporosis are not eligible.

          -  Non-malignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that would
             preclude a patient from being subjected to any of the treatment options or would
             prevent prolonged follow-up.

          -  Psychiatric or addictive disorders that would preclude obtaining informed consent.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. This protocol excludes
             pregnant or lactating women because the effects of clodronate on such women have not
             been studied fully.

          -  Bilateral malignancy or a mass or mammographic abnormality in the opposite breast
             suspicious for malignancy unless there is biopsy proof that the mass is not malignant.

             subunit, Pax-8, TTF-2, Pit-I, Tg, PDS, and NIS.

          2. Patients with thyroid function test (TFT) abnormalities due to:

               -  Non-thyroidal illness

               -  Abnormalities of serum TH binding proteins leading to euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia

        Inclusion and exclusion criteria for each group of subjects are given below.

        Patients with known or suspected thyroid abnormalities will be eligible to p rticipate if
        the individual meets all of the following criteria:

          1. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the
             duration of the study.

          2. Male or female, aged 6 months+.

        Hyperthyroid states include but are not restricted to:

          1. Graves' disease (GD) thought to result from thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins
             (TSIg's), a subclass of which also stimulate eye muscle and fatty tissue producing
             exophthalmos (Graves' ophthalmopathy), as well as the skin in the pretibial area
             causing pretibial myxedema (Graves' dermopathy);

          2. Subacute thyroiditis (SAT), a painful inflammation thought to result from viral
             infection with Coxsackie, as well as other viruses;

          3. Silent thyroiditis, a painless inflammation thought to result from autoimmune attack
             of thyrocytes by antimicrosomal antibodies directed against thyroid peroxidase (TPO),
             as well as antithyroglobulin(anti-Tg) antibodies;

          4. Single or multiple hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules of unknown etiology, probably
             resulting from the activation of certain thyroid oncogenes and/or growth factors, such
             as the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor (TSHR) and the a-subunit of the G protein (Ga);

          5. Iodide-induced hyperthyroidism of unknown etiology;

          6. Surreptitious administration of thyroid hormone (TH), usually present in patients with
             underlying psychiatric disease or occasionally related to patients with obesity and
             other eating disorders

          7. Trophoblastic neoplasms, thought to result from high levels of hCG secretion, which,
             because of its structural similarity to TSH, causes ""spillover"" of action at the TSHR
             level;

          8. ""Inappropriate"" secretion of TSH, which may be present either in patients with TSH-
             producing pituitary tumors (TSHomas) or from a non-neoplastic cause, i.e. pituitary
             resistance to the action of thyroid hormone (3,4).

        Hypothyroid states include but are not restricted to:

          1. Primary (or thyroidal) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from auto-antibodies to
             thyroid proteins, such as antimicrosomal antibodies to TPO usually associated with
             lymphocytic (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis (HT) or atrophic thyroiditis, or blocking
             antibodies to the TSHR, usually in the context of non-goitrous hypothyroidism;

          2. Secondary (or pituitary) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from tumors of the
             pituitary of non-thyrotropic origin such, as growth hormone (GH)-secreting tumors or
             prolactinomas;

          3. Tertiary (or hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from a deficiency in the
             hypothalamic hormone thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), either of unknown etiology
             or secondary to a pituitary tumor;

          4. Bio-inactive TSH, either relating to an endogenous abnormality of hypothalamic
             hormones or secondary to pituitary tumors (and usually related to abnormal
             glycosylation patterns of the TSH molecule);

          5. Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH), a disease which has been shown to be
             due to abnormalities in the TH receptor, c-erbA-beta (or TR- beta).

        The above are the principal disorders under study, but we may also investigate other
        abnormalities, such as extreme iodine deficiency, and inherited forms of hypothyroidism
        resulting from abnormalities in the expression of genes coding for the TSH- beta subunit,
        Pax-8, TTF-2, Pit-I, Tg, PDS, and NIS (among others).

        The Stuttering Severity Index -3 (Riley, 1981) has been found to be accurate for
        identifying and assessing the severity of stuttering during conversational speech. For the
        inclusion of a stuttering subject we require:

        i. A total overall score of 11 or greater between 3 and 17 years,

        ii. A total overall score of 18 or greater from age 18 and above.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFYING FPPD:

        i. A family history of an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance of the speech disorder
        over several generations with persistence into adulthood in some cases,

        ii. Speech symptoms during conversational speech include: deletion of final consonants;
        syllable reduction and syllable deletion; deletion of grammatical markers such as copulas,
        auxiliaries, prepositions, connectives; poor ability to self-correct; poor awareness of
        errors; and consonant cluster reduction.

        iii. Greater than 9% discourse errors during analysis of a sample of 300 syllables.

        iv. A discrepancy of 30 points (1 and 1/2 Standard Deviations) between receptive (the
        higher score) and expressive percentile score on the PPVT III and Expressive Vocabulary
        Test.

        v. For subjects greater than 7 years of age, a phonological process rating of 3 or more for
        any phonological process on the Khan-Lewis Phonological Analysis. For subjects less than 7
        years of age, a phonological process rating of 3 or more on 2 phonological processes on the
        Khan-Lewis Phonological Analysis. Finally, any subjects with a non developmental
        phonological process error will be identified as potentially having FPPD.

        ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR DOWN SYNDROME PARTICIPANTS:

          -  Confirmed chromosomal diagnosis of Down syndrome.

          -  Age at entry into the study is 30 years or under. This upper age limit at study entry
             is being implemented for the Down syndrome group for several reasons. First, much of
             the research using magnetic resonance imaging with this population is focused on
             (older) adult populations and in particular the transition to early onset Alzheimer s
             disease. Because most (if not all) individuals with Down syndrome demonstrate some
             brain pathology consistent with Alzheimer s disease by age 30 (e.g., plaques and
             tangles; Mann & Esiri, 1989), we would like to enroll participants who are 30 years of
             age and under. Second, studying children and young adults with Down syndrome fills a
             significant gap in the literature, as there are very few structural magnetic resonance
             imaging studies of children and young adults with Down syndrome reported in the
             literature to date, and the majority of these studies are characterized by small
             samples of convenience (i.e., clinic populations). Thus, there is still a need to
             describe the developmental course of this disorder from early childhood to young
             adulthood. Such developmental research may help shed light on the causes of
             intellectual disability in Down syndrome and also identify individuals with the
             syndrome who are most at risk for experiencing the cognitive decline that is reported
             in the literature for some individuals after the age of 30 (Oliver et al., 1998).

        The categories of subjects eligible to participate in this study include:

          1. Patients with known or suspected thyroid abnormalities (e.g. hypothyroidism,
             hyperthyroidism, extreme iodine deficiency, and inherited forms of hypothyroidism
             resulting from abnormalities in the expression of genes coding for the TSH- beta
             subunit, Pax-8, TTF-2, Pit-I, Tg, PDS, and NIS.

          2. Patients with thyroid function test (TFT) abnormalities due to:

               -  Non-thyroidal illness

               -  Abnormalities of serum TH binding proteins leading to euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia

                  TSH ultrasensitive (""3rd generation"") assay which may mimic ""inappropriate""
                  secretion of TSH.

        Inclusion and exclusion criteria for each group of subjects are given below.

        Patients with known or suspected thyroid abnormalities will be eligible to p rticipate if
        the individual meets all of the following criteria:

          1. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the
             duration of the study.

          2. Male or female, aged 6 months+.

        Hyperthyroid states include but are not restricted to:

          1. Graves' disease (GD) thought to result from thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins
             (TSIg's), a subclass of which also stimulate eye muscle and fatty tissue producing
             exophthalmos (Graves' ophthalmopathy), as well as the skin in the pretibial area
             causing pretibial myxedema (Graves' dermopathy);

          2. Subacute thyroiditis (SAT), a painful inflammation thought to result from viral
             infection with Coxsackie, as well as other viruses;

          3. Silent thyroiditis, a painless inflammation thought to result from autoimmune attack
             of thyrocytes by antimicrosomal antibodies directed against thyroid peroxidase (TPO),
             as well as antithyroglobulin(anti-Tg) antibodies;

          4. Single or multiple hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules of unknown etiology, probably
             resulting from the activation of certain thyroid oncogenes and/or growth factors, such
             as the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor (TSHR) and the a-subunit of the G protein (Ga);

          5. Iodide-induced hyperthyroidism of unknown etiology;

          6. Surreptitious administration of thyroid hormone (TH), usually present in patients with
             underlying psychiatric disease or occasionally related to patients with obesity and
             other eating disorders

          7. Trophoblastic neoplasms, thought to result from high levels of hCG secretion, which,
             because of its structural similarity to TSH, causes ""spillover"" of action at the TSHR
             level;

          8. ""Inappropriate"" secretion of TSH, which may be present either in patients with TSH-
             producing pituitary tumors (TSHomas) or from a non-neoplastic cause, i.e. pituitary
             resistance to the action of thyroid hormone (3,4).

        Hypothyroid states include but are not restricted to:

          1. Primary (or thyroidal) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from auto-antibodies to
             thyroid proteins, such as antimicrosomal antibodies to TPO usually associated with
             lymphocytic (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis (HT) or atrophic thyroiditis, or blocking
             antibodies to the TSHR, usually in the context of non-goitrous hypothyroidism;

          2. Secondary (or pituitary) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from tumors of the
             pituitary of non-thyrotropic origin such, as growth hormone (GH)-secreting tumors or
             prolactinomas;

          3. Tertiary (or hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from a deficiency in the
             hypothalamic hormone thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), either of unknown etiology
             or secondary to a pituitary tumor;

          4. Bio-inactive TSH, either relating to an endogenous abnormality of hypothalamic
             hormones or secondary to pituitary tumors (and usually related to abnormal
             glycosylation patterns of the TSH molecule);

          5. Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH), a disease which has been shown to be
             due to abnormalities in the TH receptor, c-erbA-beta (or TR- beta).

        The above are the principal disorders under study, but we may also investigate other
        abnormalities, such as extreme iodine deficiency, and inherited forms of hypothyroidism
        resulting from abnormalities in the expression of genes coding for the TSH- beta subunit,
        Pax-8, TTF-2, Pit-I, Tg, PDS, and NIS (among others).

             failure.

          3. The presence of malignancy or the history of other serious, complicating illness such
             as myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident in the past six months, at the
             discretion of the investigators.

          4. For plasma exchange: A Department of Transfusion Medicine consultant will evaluate all
             potential plasma exchange patients. Those with prolonged PT, PTT, platelet count less
             than 100,000 or receiving anticoagulant therapy will undergo plasma exchange only if
             the consultant considers this to be safe.

          5. For prednisone: uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (requiring greater than 100 units of
             insulin/day with the concurrence of the Endocrinology consultant), active infection
             including hepatitis B or C (if that is the advice of the Hepatology consultant),
             infection with HIV (as these patients are at increased risk of avascular necrosis),
             other active infection (if that is the advice of the Infectious Disease consultant),
             history of avascular necrosis or bone densitometry indicating bone mass less than 2SD
             below normal, active ulcer disease, history of steroid-induced psychosis, morbid
             obesity, positive PPD or history of past positive PPD without adequate treatment are
             excluded.

          6. For Cyclophosphamide:

        A) Allergy or hypersensitivity to cyclophosphamide

        B) Leukocyte less than 3000 cells/microliter or ANC less than 1500 cells/microliter or
        evidence of bone marrow compromise

        C) Prior irradiation to the heart or therapy with doxorubicin or other cardiotoxic
        medication (may increase the risk for cardiotoxicity)

        D) Peritoneal dialysis, as there is no published evidence that cyclophosphamide metabolites
        can be safely removed.

        E) Certain drugs will be used with caution or avoided. Barbiturates and phenytoin induce
        the hepatic enzymes that metabolize cyclophosphamide and therefore if these medications are
        required, cyclophosphamide doses may need to be increased to achieve a comparable
        immunosuppressive effect. Drugs that inhibit cyclophosphamide metabolism include
        allopurinol, imipramine, and phenothiazines, chloramphenicol and chlorpromazine; these
        drugs will be avoided. NSAID increase the risk of hyponatremia; these drugs will be
        avoided.",Permeability Factor in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis,0
