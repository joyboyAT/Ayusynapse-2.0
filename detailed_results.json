    "trial_eligibility_text": "-  INCLUSION CRITERIA:\r\n\r\n        Diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) will be\r\n        made according to the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic classification. A\r\n        lymphocyte count in excess of 5000/mcl is typically found in the leukemic variant but is\r\n        not a pre-requisite for a diagnosis of SLL. Low, Intermediate or High-Risk Category of\r\n        CLL/SLL, using the Modified Three-Stage Rai Staging System as follows:\r\n\r\n        Risk Category: Low Risk\r\n\r\n        Rai Stage: 0\r\n\r\n        Clinical Features: Elevated blood and marrow lymphocyte numbers only (L). (lymphocytes\r\n        greater than 5000/microl in blood, and lymphocytes greater than 30 percent in marrow).\r\n\r\n        Risk Category: Intermediate Risk\r\n\r\n        Rai Stage: I\r\n\r\n        Clinical Features: L + enlarged lymph nodes (LN)\r\n\r\n        Risk Category: Intermediate Risk\r\n\r\n        Rai Stage: II\r\n\r\n        Clinical Features: L + enlarged spleen or liver\r\n\r\n        Risk Category: High Risk\r\n\r\n        Rai Stage: III\r\n\r\n        Clinical Features: L + anemia (Hemoglobin less than 11 gm/dl)\r\n\r\n        Risk Category: High Risk\r\n\r\n        Rai Stage: IV\r\n\r\n        Clinical Features: L + thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 100,000/microl)\r\n\r\n        Patients in the modified Rai high risk group and select patients in the intermediate risk\r\n        group will undergo treatment with Rituximab Fludarabine. To meet treatment criteria\r\n        patients in the intermediate risk group should have evidence of active disease as\r\n        demonstrated by at least one of the following criteria:\r\n\r\n          1. massive or progressive splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy;\r\n\r\n          2. presence of weight loss greater than 10% over the preceding 6 months;\r\n\r\n          3. constitutional symptoms of extreme fatigue, night sweats or recurrent fever of greater\r\n             than 100 degrees F (documented fevers must be occurring without evidence of specific\r\n             infection), and bone pain;\r\n\r\n          4. progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of greater than 50% over a 2 month period,\r\n             or an anticipated doubling time of less than 6 months;\r\n\r\n          5. chronic infections either increased number or prolonged infections;\r\n\r\n          6. other high risk prognostic indicators such as excess elevation of\r\n             beta-2-microglobulin, cluster differentiation 38 (CD38) expression and adverse\r\n             cytogenetics may be used to better appraise the risk in each individual patient.\r\n\r\n        Patients with a diagnosis of CLL/SLL who do not meet the eligibility criteria for receiving\r\n        Rituximab and Fludarabine (are not intermediate- or high-risk CLL/SLL), can enroll on the\r\n        protocol for the purpose of donating cellular products. Such patients will not receive\r\n        rituximab and fludarabine chemotherapy. At a later date, if it is documented that the\r\n        patient does meet the criteria, then the patient may receive Rituximab and Fludarabine\r\n        (after discussion with the Principal Investigator).\r\n\r\n        In a limited number of cases, patients with low-risk CLL/SLL may be initiated on Rituximab\r\n        and Fludarabine treatment. For example, individuals who are candidates for bone marrow\r\n        transplantation may be started on Rituximab Fludarabine as an induction regimen prior to\r\n        transplantation. Additionally, some low-risk patients may be started on Rituximab and\r\n        Fludarabine for psychological reasons (patient insistence on starting chemotherapy prior to\r\n        disease progression). However, it must be stressed that low-risk CLL/SLL patients will be\r\n        discouraged from initiating therapy except in these specific cases.\r\n\r\n        Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age.\r\n\r\n        Patients must have received no prior cytotoxic or monoclonal antibody therapy.\r\n\r\n        Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.\r\n\r\n        Required initial laboratory tests: Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and Creatinine values must be\r\n        less than or equal to 1.5 times the normal values; alternatively, patients with creatinine\r\n        clearance of greater than 50 ml per minute will also be eligible. Aspartate\r\n        aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values must be less than or equal\r\n        to 2.0 times normal values; patients with laboratory values greater than these levels may\r\n        be enrolled on the protocol (after a specific approval from the Principal Investigator) if\r\n        the values are due to a known, pre-existing liver disease. Bilirubin must be less than or\r\n        equal to 2.0 mg/dl unless due to Gilbert's disease.\r\n\r\n        The patient must be competent to sign an informed consent, and sign the protocol consent\r\n        form.\r\n\r\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\r\n\r\n        Patients must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.\r\n\r\n        Patients with active autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)) grade III or higher (transfusion\r\n        or steroids indicated) or immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) grade III or higher (platelets less\r\n        than 50,000/microL) shall not be enrolled. Patients with a history of prior therapy to\r\n        control either AIHA or ITP will be eligible, provided they do not require maintenance\r\n        corticosteroids, and have not received monoclonal antibody therapy in the past 6 months.\r\n        Patients developing AIHA or ITP on protocol may be managed as medically indicated on\r\n        protocol but will generally not undergo fludarabine/rituximab treatment until resolution of\r\n        hemolysis or thrombocytopenia to less than grade III.\r\n\r\n        Any patient with a medical condition that requires chronic use of corticosteroids shall not\r\n        be enrolled.",

Required Tumor Parameters\r\n\r\n             1.1 Patients with operable, histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the female\r\n             breast and positive lymph nodes. Node positivity may be determined by either an\r\n             axillary node dissection or a positive sentinel node finding by immunohistochemistry\r\n             or histology. This includes any patient with one or more positive lymph nodes whose\r\n             tumors are T0, T1, 2 or 3 and N1, N2, MO. Patients with metaplastic carcinoma are\r\n             eligible. Bilateral disease does not exclude patients from entry.\r\n\r\n             1.2 Tumors that are locally advanced at diagnosis are not eligible. This is left to\r\n             investigator judgment. Patients with tumors fixed to the chest wall, peau d'orange\r\n             skin changes, skin ulcerations, or clinical inflammatory changes (T4 disease) are\r\n             excluded from this study. Dermal lymphatic involvement noted on pathology without\r\n             clinical inflammatory changes will not exclude a patient from this study.\r\n\r\n             1.3 Patients with any ERP/PgR status are eligible.\r\n\r\n          2.

Patients who received radiation to\r\n             the breast for DCIS are eligible. Patients who have had segmental mastectomy will be\r\n             treated with radiotherapy according to standard procedures in the treating physician's\r\n             institution after completion of all chemotherapy.

Male or female, aged 6 months+.\r\n\r\n        Hyperthyroid states include but are not restricted to:\r\n\r\n          1. Graves' disease (GD) thought to result from thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins\r\n             (TSIg's), a subclass of which also stimulate eye muscle and fatty tissue producing\r\n             exophthalmos (Graves' ophthalmopathy), as well as the skin in the pretibial area\r\n             causing pretibial myxedema (Graves' dermopathy);\r\n\r\n          2. Subacute thyroiditis (SAT), a painful inflammation thought to result from viral\r\n             infection with Coxsackie, as well as other viruses;\r\n\r\n          3. Silent thyroiditis, a painless inflammation thought to result from autoimmune attack\r\n             of thyrocytes by antimicrosomal antibodies directed against thyroid peroxidase (TPO),\r\n             as well as antithyroglobulin(anti-Tg) antibodies;\r\n\r\n          4. Single or multiple hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules of unknown etiology, probably\r\n             resulting from the activation of certain thyroid oncogenes and/or growth factors, such\r\n             as the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor (TSHR) and the a-subunit of the G protein (Ga);\r\n\r\n          5. Iodide-induced hyperthyroidism of unknown etiology;\r\n\r\n          6.

Trophoblastic neoplasms, thought to result from high levels of hCG secretion, which,\r\n             because of its structural similarity to TSH, causes \"spillover\" of action at the TSHR\r\n             level;\r\n\r\n          8. \"Inappropriate\" secretion of TSH, which may be present either in patients with TSH-\r\n             producing pituitary tumors (TSHomas) or from a non-neoplastic cause, i.e. pituitary\r\n             resistance to the action of thyroid hormone (3,4).\r\n\r\n        Hypothyroid states include but are not restricted to:\r\n\r\n          1. Primary (or thyroidal) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from auto-antibodies to\r\n             thyroid proteins, such as antimicrosomal antibodies to TPO usually associated with\r\n             lymphocytic (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis (HT) or atrophic thyroiditis, or blocking\r\n             antibodies to the TSHR, usually in the context of non-goitrous hypothyroidism;\r\n\r\n          2. Secondary (or pituitary) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from tumors of the\r\n             pituitary of non-thyrotropic origin such, as growth hormone (GH)-secreting tumors or\r\n             prolactinomas;\r\n\r\n          3. Tertiary (or hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from a deficiency in the\r\n             hypothalamic hormone thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), either of unknown etiology\r\n             or secondary to a pituitary tumor;\r\n\r\n          4. Bio-inactive TSH, either relating to an endogenous abnormality of hypothalamic\r\n             hormones or secondary to pituitary tumors (and usually related to abnormal\r\n             glycosylation patterns of the TSH molecule);\r\n\r\n          5. Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH), a disease which has been shown to be\r\n             due to abnormalities in the TH receptor, c-erbA-beta (or TR- beta).\r\n\r\n        The above are the principal disorders under study, but we may also investigate other\r\n        abnormalities, such as extreme iodine deficiency, and inherited forms of hypothyroidism\r\n        resulting from abnormalities in the expression of genes coding for the TSH- beta subunit,\r\n        Pax-8, TTF-2, Pit-I, Tg, PDS, and NIS (among others).\r\n\r\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\r\n\r\n        There are no exclusion criteria for subjects with known or suspected thyroid abnormalities.",

    "trial_eligibility_text": "-INCLUSION CRITERIA:\r\n\r\n        i. Normal Language Development, Hearing and Cognition\r\n\r\n        ii. The following screening tests previously published with norms were found to have a good\r\n        distribution for determining normal functioning in adolescents and adults as all subjects\r\n        did not hit ceiling and all had scores greater than or equal to the 80th percentile. These\r\n        tests are being used to ensure that subjects affected with stuttering or FPPD do not have\r\n        other disorders such as hearing loss, language delay, or mental retardation.\r\n\r\n        Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III (PPVT-III)\r\n\r\n        Expressive Vocabulary Test (EVT)\r\n\r\n        Oral Speech Mechanism Screening Examination\r\n\r\n        Revised Token Test; Token test for Children\r\n\r\n        Test of Non verbal intelligence (TONI-2)\r\n\r\n        Digit Span subtest of the WICS-R\r\n\r\n        Audiometric Screening\r\n\r\n        Goldman Fristoe Test of Articulation\r\n\r\n        WUG Test of Morphological Encoding\r\n\r\n        Test of Auditory Comprehension of Language (TACL)\r\n\r\n        Khan-Lewis Phonological Analysis\r\n\r\n        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFYING AND QUANTIFYING STUTTERING:\r\n\r\n        The Stuttering Severity Index -3 (Riley, 1981) has been found to be accurate for\r\n        identifying and assessing the severity of stuttering during conversational speech. For the\r\n        inclusion of a stuttering subject we require:\r\n\r\n        i. A total overall score of 11 or greater between 3 and 17 years,\r\n\r\n        ii. A total overall score of 18 or greater from age 18 and above.\r\n\r\n        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFYING FPPD:\r\n\r\n        i. A family history of an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance of the speech disorder\r\n        over several generations with persistence into adulthood in some cases,\r\n\r\n        ii. Speech symptoms during conversational speech include: deletion of final consonants;\r\n        syllable reduction and syllable deletion; deletion of grammatical markers such as copulas,\r\n        auxiliaries, prepositions, connectives; poor ability to self-correct; poor awareness of\r\n        errors; and consonant cluster reduction.\r\n\r\n        iii. Greater than 9% discourse errors during analysis of a sample of 300 syllables.\r\n\r\n        iv. A discrepancy of 30 points (1 and 1/2 Standard Deviations) between receptive (the\r\n        higher score) and expressive percentile score on the PPVT III and Expressive Vocabulary\r\n        Test.\r\n\r\n        v. For subjects greater than 7 years of age, a phonological process rating of 3 or more for\r\n        any phonological process on the Khan-Lewis Phonological Analysis. For subjects less than 7\r\n        years of age, a phonological process rating of 3 or more on 2 phonological processes on the\r\n        Khan-Lewis Phonological Analysis. Finally, any subjects with a non developmental\r\n        phonological process error will be identified as potentially having FPPD.\r\n\r\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\r\n\r\n        i. Anyone with a hearing loss will be excluded from participation during the diagnostic\r\n        testing.\r\n\r\n        ii. Children with delayed language, more than 1 year delay from norms on receptive and\r\n        expression language testing will be excluded.\r\n\r\n        iii. Language impairment: scores more than 2 standard deviations below the age appropriate\r\n        score on the standardized language tests listed under the inclusion criteria.\r\n\r\n        iv. Cognitive impairment: scores more than 2 standard deviations below the age appropriate\r\n        score on the standardized cognitive tests listed under the inclusion criteria.\r\n\r\n        v. Bilingual non-native English speakers - Studies have demonstrated that brain\r\n        organization for speech and language may differ in bilingual persons. It is hypothesized\r\n        that this may alter speech motor learning and thus kinematic data from non-native English\r\n        speakers would differ from native English speakers. Therefore, only native-American English\r\n        speakers, with only one language spoken in the home, will be included.",

Currently meet criteria for at least\r\n             one of the following:\r\n\r\n               -  DSM-IV (or other approved) criteria for one of the following clinical diagnoses:\r\n                  Multi-Dimensionally Impaired, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Childhood Onset\r\n                  Schizophrenia, Turner Syndrome, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Asperger Syndrome, High\r\n                  Functioning Autism, Pervasive Development Disorder\r\n\r\n               -  Sex chromosome aneuploidy as determined by karyotype (including XXX, XXXX, XXXXX,\r\n                  XXY, XXYY, XXXY, XXXXY, XYY).\r\n\r\n               -  ICD-10 criteria for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, Cushings Syndrome, Kallmann\r\n                  Syndrome, normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, Androgen Insensitivity\r\n                  Syndrome\r\n\r\n               -  ADHD\r\n\r\n               -  Down s Syndrome\r\n\r\n          -  Newly enrolled adults and minors once they become adults over age 18 who cannot give\r\n             consent due to limited capacity may have a surrogate, i.e., a legally responsible\r\n             representative (LAR), sign the consent. LARs include DPA holders, court-appointed\r\n             legal guardians, or parents or siblings over 18 years of age. We will consult with the\r\n             Human Subjects Protection Unit as necessary.\r\n\r\n        ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ADHD PARTICIPANTS:\r\n\r\n        Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) defined\r\n        ADHD. The DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD will be based on the Parent Diagnostic Interview for\r\n        Children and Adolescents.\r\n\r\n        -Conners Teacher Hyperactivity rating greater than 2 SD above age- and sex-specific means.\r\n\r\n        ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR DOWN SYNDROME PARTICIPANTS:\r\n\r\n          -  Confirmed chromosomal diagnosis of Down syndrome.\r\n\r\n          -  Age at entry into the study is 30 years or under. This upper age limit at study entry\r\n             is being implemented for the Down syndrome group for several reasons. First, much of\r\n             the research using magnetic resonance imaging with this population is focused on\r\n             (older) adult populations and in particular the transition to early onset Alzheimer s\r\n             disease. Because most (if not all) individuals with Down syndrome demonstrate some\r\n             brain pathology consistent with Alzheimer s disease by age 30 (e.g., plaques and\r\n             tangles; Mann & Esiri, 1989), we would like to enroll participants who are 30 years of\r\n             age and under. Second, studying children and young adults with Down syndrome fills a\r\n             significant gap in the literature, as there are very few structural magnetic resonance\r\n             imaging studies of children and young adults with Down syndrome reported in the\r\n             literature to date, and the majority of these studies are characterized by small\r\n             samples of convenience (i.e., clinic populations). Thus, there is still a need to\r\n             describe the developmental course of this disorder from early childhood to young\r\n             adulthood. Such developmental research may help shed light on the causes of\r\n             intellectual disability in Down syndrome and also identify individuals with the\r\n             syndrome who are most at risk for experiencing the cognitive decline that is reported\r\n             in the literature for some individuals after the age of 30 (Oliver et al., 1998).\r\n\r\n        ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPANTS WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS:\r\n\r\n          -  Meeting DSM-IV criteria for one of the pervasive developmental disorders (i.e.,\r\n             autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder-not\r\n             otherwise specified).\r\n\r\n          -  Having a minimum IQ of 70.\r\n\r\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\r\n\r\n        NIMH staff and their immediate family are excluded from participation.\r\n\r\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY CONTROLS:\r\n\r\n          -  Presence of severe psychiatric disorder (as diagnosed prior to subject study\r\n             enrollment) in the subject, sibling, or other first-degree relative.

We will obtain individual\r\n                  histories that provide information as to age, sex, race, surgical and medical\r\n                  histories, and family history. Our purpose is to examine whether particular\r\n                  genetic variants, including those in MYH9, influence the ability of the kidney to\r\n                  undergo hypertrophy following renal donation or the propensity to manifest\r\n                  albuminuria as a sign of glomerular stress. These findings have the potential to\r\n                  extend our understanding of the biology of MYH9 and might have clinical relevance\r\n                  for selecting kidney donors.\r\n\r\n               8. Tamil population. We will recruit from a Tamil population. A Tamil will be\r\n                  defined as anyone that identifies themselves, their parents and their\r\n                  grandparents as Tamilian. We will ask these patients about their family history.\r\n                  We will exclude subjects under 18 and multiple subjects within the same family.\r\n                  We will draw blood for genetic testing. Our purpose is to determine whether\r\n                  particular genetic variants, including those in MYH9, are prevalent in a Tamilian\r\n                  population. If prevalence is indicated, we hope to study how these variants\r\n                  influence the progression of kidney disease in this population.\r\n\r\n               9. Women who are pregnant will be excluded from participating in the apheresis\r\n                  component of this protocol.",

Trophoblastic neoplasms, thought to result from high levels of hCG secretion, which,\r\n             because of its structural similarity to TSH, causes \"spillover\" of action at the TSHR\r\n             level;\r\n\r\n          8. \"Inappropriate\" secretion of TSH, which may be present either in patients with TSH-\r\n             producing pituitary tumors (TSHomas) or from a non-neoplastic cause, i.e. pituitary\r\n             resistance to the action of thyroid hormone (3,4).\r\n\r\n        Hypothyroid states include but are not restricted to:\r\n\r\n          1. Primary (or thyroidal) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from auto-antibodies to\r\n             thyroid proteins, such as antimicrosomal antibodies to TPO usually associated with\r\n             lymphocytic (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis (HT) or atrophic thyroiditis, or blocking\r\n             antibodies to the TSHR, usually in the context of non-goitrous hypothyroidism;\r\n\r\n          2. Secondary (or pituitary) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from tumors of the\r\n             pituitary of non-thyrotropic origin such, as growth hormone (GH)-secreting tumors or\r\n             prolactinomas;\r\n\r\n          3. Tertiary (or hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, usually resulting from a deficiency in the\r\n             hypothalamic hormone thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), either of unknown etiology\r\n             or secondary to a pituitary tumor;\r\n\r\n          4. Bio-inactive TSH, either relating to an endogenous abnormality of hypothalamic\r\n             hormones or secondary to pituitary tumors (and usually related to abnormal\r\n             glycosylation patterns of the TSH molecule);\r\n\r\n          5. Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH), a disease which has been shown to be\r\n             due to abnormalities in the TH receptor, c-erbA-beta (or TR- beta).\r\n\r\n        The above are the principal disorders under study, but we may also investigate other\r\n        abnormalities, such as extreme iodine deficiency, and inherited forms of hypothyroidism\r\n        resulting from abnormalities in the expression of genes coding for the TSH- beta subunit,\r\n        Pax-8, TTF-2, Pit-I, Tg, PDS, and NIS (among others).\r\n\r\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\r\n\r\n        There are no exclusion criteria for subjects with known or suspected thyroid abnormalities.",

For the\r\n        inclusion of a stuttering subject we require:\r\n\r\n        i. A total overall score of 11 or greater between 3 and 17 years,\r\n\r\n        ii.

A family history of an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance of the speech disorder\r\n        over several generations with persistence into adulthood in some cases,\r\n\r\n        ii. Speech symptoms during conversational speech include: deletion of final consonants;\r\n        syllable reduction and syllable deletion; deletion of grammatical markers such as copulas,\r\n        auxiliaries, prepositions, connectives; poor ability to self-correct; poor awareness of\r\n        errors; and consonant cluster reduction.\r\n\r\n        iii.

The presence of malignancy or the history of other serious, complicating illness such\r\n             as myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident in the past six months, at the\r\n             discretion of the investigators.\r\n\r\n          4. For plasma exchange: A Department of Transfusion Medicine consultant will evaluate all\r\n             potential plasma exchange patients. Those with prolonged PT, PTT, platelet count less\r\n             than 100,000 or receiving anticoagulant therapy will undergo plasma exchange only if\r\n             the consultant considers this to be safe.\r\n\r\n          5. For prednisone: uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (requiring greater than 100 units of\r\n             insulin/day with the concurrence of the Endocrinology consultant), active infection\r\n             including hepatitis B or C (if that is the advice of the Hepatology consultant),\r\n             infection with HIV (as these patients are at increased risk of avascular necrosis),\r\n             other active infection (if that is the advice of the Infectious Disease consultant),\r\n             history of avascular necrosis or bone densitometry indicating bone mass less than 2SD\r\n             below normal, active ulcer disease, history of steroid-induced psychosis, morbid\r\n             obesity, positive PPD or history of past positive PPD without adequate treatment are\r\n             excluded.\r\n\r\n          6. For Cyclophosphamide:\r\n\r\n        A) Allergy or hypersensitivity to cyclophosphamide\r\n\r\n        B) Leukocyte less than 3000 cells/microliter or ANC less than 1500 cells/microliter or\r\n        evidence of bone marrow compromise\r\n\r\n        C) Prior irradiation to the heart or therapy with doxorubicin or other cardiotoxic\r\n        medication (may increase the risk for cardiotoxicity)\r\n\r\n        D) Peritoneal dialysis, as there is no published evidence that cyclophosphamide metabolites\r\n        can be safely removed.\r\n\r\n        E) Certain drugs will be used with caution or avoided. Barbiturates and phenytoin induce\r\n        the hepatic enzymes that metabolize cyclophosphamide and therefore if these medications are\r\n        required, cyclophosphamide doses may need to be increased to achieve a comparable\r\n        immunosuppressive effect. Drugs that inhibit cyclophosphamide metabolism include\r\n        allopurinol, imipramine, and phenothiazines, chloramphenicol and chlorpromazine; these\r\n        drugs will be avoided. NSAID increase the risk of hyponatremia; these drugs will be\r\n        avoided.",
